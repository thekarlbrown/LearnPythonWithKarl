- Python Lesson 1 - 
By Karl Brown

Here is a series of shorthand tutorials to help individuals learn Python. I will be improving them as more individuals attempt them, and extending them as interest forces me to reach the end of my lessons.

- My additional write-up - 

Variables in real life: someone says "hey , lets go to dinner at 5:00 pm"
The computer must save the data somehow
A variable is means of saving that data, just like the human brain remembers sentences, numbers, etc
So 'hey, lets go to dinner at 5:00 pm' would be a string. it could have the name 'karlconvo' set to the value of the following characters 'hey, lets go to dinner at 5:00 pm'
If you asked me what time dinner was, and I said 5pm, it could be an integer with the name 'dinnertime' set to the value of '5'
If you asked what time dinner was and you said 5:15 pm, the time could be stored as a float named "dinnertime" with the value '5.15' (if you so choose to store it that way)
Alternatively, you could use 17.15 as it is pm and the day is 24 hours
Integers are whole numbers, floats can have decimals
Everything is an object in python, including variables.
Quotes are how the computer can tell if you are typing in code to be interpretted (typing in code) or just typing it text to be set to a value (setting a string, using text humans understand not code)
